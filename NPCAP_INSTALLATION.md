# Resolving libpcap Warning in Windows IDS

## Problem

If you see the following warning when running the NIDS component:

```
WARNING: No libpcap provider available! pcap won't be used
```

This means that the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) component cannot capture network packets because the required packet capture drivers are not installed or not properly configured. Without these drivers, the NIDS component will not be able to monitor network traffic for potential threats.

## Solution

### Install Npcap (Recommended)

Npcap is the recommended packet capture library for Windows and is required for the NIDS component to function properly.

1. Download Npcap from the [official Npcap website](https://npcap.com/#download)
2. Run the installer with administrator privileges
3. **Important:** During installation, make sure to select the following options:
   - Select "WinPcap API-compatible Mode" (critical for Scapy compatibility)
   - Check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"
   - Check "Install Npcap Loopback Adapter" (for capturing local traffic)
4. Complete the installation
5. Restart your computer to ensure all drivers are properly loaded
6. Run the IDS dashboard again using `run_dashboard.bat`

### Alternative: Install WinPcap

If you cannot install Npcap for some reason, you can try WinPcap instead (note that WinPcap is older and no longer actively maintained):

1. Download WinPcap from the [official WinPcap website](https://www.winpcap.org/install/)
2. Run the installer with administrator privileges
3. Complete the installation
4. Restart your computer
5. Run the IDS dashboard again using `run_dashboard.bat`

**Note:** WinPcap is not compatible with Windows 10/11 by default. Npcap is strongly recommended for modern Windows systems.

## Verifying Installation

To verify that the packet capture drivers are properly installed:

1. Check if the following files exist:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\wpcap.dll` (WinPcap API library)
   - `C:\Windows\System32\Packet.dll` (Packet capture library)
   - `C:\Windows\System32\Npcap` (directory, if using Npcap)

2. Run the IDS dashboard using `run_dashboard.bat`
   - The script will automatically check for the presence of Npcap or WinPcap
   - You should see a green message indicating "Npcap detected" or "WinPcap detected"

3. Check the NIDS component window for any warnings
   - If you don't see the "No libpcap provider available" warning, the installation was successful

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues after installing Npcap or WinPcap:

1. **Administrator Privileges**
   - Make sure you're running the IDS with administrator privileges
   - Right-click on `run_dashboard.bat` and select "Run as administrator"

2. **Security Software Conflicts**
   - Check if your antivirus or security software is blocking the packet capture functionality
   - Temporarily disable your antivirus or add an exception for the IDS application

3. **Reinstall Npcap**
   - Uninstall any existing Npcap or WinPcap installations from Control Panel
   - Download and install the latest version of Npcap
   - Make sure to select all the recommended options during installation

4. **Check Network Adapter Settings**
   - Open Device Manager and ensure your network adapters are functioning properly
   - Look for any warning icons next to network adapters

5. **Scapy Installation**
   - Verify Scapy is properly installed by running: `python -c "import scapy; print(scapy.__version__)"`
   - If you get an error, reinstall Scapy: `pip install scapy==2.5.0`

6. **Windows Updates**
   - Ensure your Windows system is up to date
   - Some Windows updates can affect network driver compatibility
7. **Check Log Files**
   - Examine the logs in the `logs` directory for more detailed error messages
   - Look specifically at `logs/ids_nids.log` for NIDS-related errors
   - Search for terms like "pcap", "libpcap", "Npcap", or "packet capture"

## Conclusion

The "No libpcap provider available" warning occurs when Scapy cannot find the necessary packet capture libraries on your Windows system. By installing Npcap with the correct options, you should be able to resolve this issue and enable the NIDS component to properly monitor network traffic.

If you continue to experience issues after following all the troubleshooting steps, please check the project's issue tracker or contact the development team for further assistance.
